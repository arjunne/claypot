######h6 options payoff workbench

###Framework

Choose a stock or type it in. Option chain appears (with or without greeks). All expiries are on top, selectable. You drag and drop options to an area below, like in dough.com
  
As you do that, the option graph appears. You can change positions (long/short), quantities, and price. The payoff graph is automatic, below.

Special areas for the vol smile graph, and for the option pain graph.

Needs a login per person, needs to save positions and load them back, set up options like brokerage costs. Margin calcs should be auto for India.

All this with responsive behaviour.
